Description: Proof of concept of embedding 2 'Bootstrap' input elements
    into a single HTML widget. This reduces the number of inputs to handle on the
    Shiny side. Typically, there is only 1 global input recovers which contains the
    widget state and as many HTML inputs as we want. We also provide an example on
    how to restore the widget state with the Shiny bookmarking capability.
